          <h3>What is WeGo?</h3>
          <p>Our mission is to create opportunities for enrichment, enjoyment, and communication to our clients, through the implementation of telepresence technology and programming. Additionally, we hope to promote innovation for new and profound avenues of human connection.</p>
          <h3>Our Work</h3>
          <p>WeGo currently connects inpatient pediatric patients with three local Baltimore attractions - the NA, Maryland Science Center, and Baltimore Center Stage - through telepresence visits. Our program not only strengthens the Baltimore community by creating new connections, but also improves the inpatient experience by positively impacting the children involved. We aim to achieve normalization through socialization, by combating social and psychological obstacles linked to hospitals and illness. With WeGo, pediatric patients gain independence from their medical treatments and transcend the physical boundaries of their inpatient experience. Concurrently, we believe that utilizing technology to create a more united and connected community will strengthen the bonds between institutions in Baltimore, and will break down social barriers for populations such as children at JHCC.</p>

              <div class="science-text">
                <p>The WeGo Foundation began in early 2016, when Galen Shi initiated a partnership between the National Aquarium and Johns Hopkins Children’s Center in order to establish a pediatric telepresence program. By early 2017, approval was obtained on both sides of the partnership and a pilot program was launched. The pilot was a major success, garnering exceptional reviews from users, families, and staff from both the National Aquarium and Johns Hopkins Children’s Center. This exposure led to new opportunities and additional partnerships with the Maryland Science Center and Baltimore Center Stage.</p>

          <h3>Telepresence</h3>
          <div class="image-right">
            <div class="science-text">
              <p>A telepresence robot connects a person to a location through the internet.  The robot can explore a location in a way that the operator can see, hear, talk and move around as if they are physically there. Robots like this are used in healthcare, education and business for a variety of purposes.</p>
              <p>VGo is one of many manufacturers in the telepresence robotics field, and is the model provided to NA free of charge during the pilot. VGo is about 4 feet tall and the base is one square foot. It weighs less than 20 pounds. It has navigation lights at the base as well as on the top camera. It doesn’t move faster than walking speed and has an auto-stop sensor when the wheels bump against an object, such as a foot or
              exhibit.</p>

              <p>Since its founding 1981, the National Aquarium has educated generations of Maryland families. Located in the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, the aquarium is committed to the education and inspiration of Maryland school children, educating over 100,000 local Maryland children a year. The non-profit aquarium’s dedication to Maryland families and children aligns with the WeGo Foundation’s mission for enriching the lives of pediatric inpatients in the Baltimore area. This alignment has furthered the partnership between the two organizations, leading to the development of telepresence tours and programs for children at the Johns Hopkins Children's Center.</p>
