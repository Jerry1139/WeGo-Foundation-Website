          <h3>Mission & Vision</h3>

          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>The WeGo Foundation began in early 2016, when Galen Shi initiated a partnership between the National Aquarium and Johns Hopkins Children’s Center in order to establish a pediatric telepresence program. By early 2017, approval was obtained on both sides of the partnership and a pilot program was launched. The pilot was a major success, garnering exceptional reviews from users, families, and staff from both the National Aquarium and Johns Hopkins Children’s Center. This exposure led to new opportunities and additional partnerships with the Maryland Science Center and Baltimore Center Stage.</p>

        <div id="telepresence" class="tab-pane fade">
          <h3>Telepresence</h3>
          <p>A telepresence robot connects a person to a location through the internet.  The robot can explore a location in a way that the operator can see, hear, talk and move around as if they are physically there. Robots like this are used in healthcare, education and business for a variety of purposes.</p>
          <p>VGo is one of many manufacturers in the telepresence robotics field, and is the model provided to NA free of charge during the pilot. VGo is about 4 feet tall and the base is one square foot. It weighs less than 20 pounds. It has navigation lights at the base as well as on the top camera. It doesn’t move faster than walking speed and has an auto-stop sensor when the wheels bump against an object, such as a foot or
          exhibit.</p>
